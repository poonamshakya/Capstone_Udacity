Project on Credit card fraud detection, data set year(2018)

## Domain Background 

Credit card fraud is a type of crime that is on the rise (link) and this is a risk to everyone who uses this payment method. I surely know how annoying is to find that your credit card was frauded and used by criminals to buy anything they want with your hard-earned money. It already happened to me 3 times even though I am not an easy target for scams. I have always taken all the recommended measures for a regular citizen to avoid frauds and yet it wasnâ€™t enough to protect me against this crime. Despite several papers on this theme were written in the last years, banks still struggle to correctly classify normal and fraudulent transactions because swindlers are always coming up with new strategies to disguise fake transactions. Delamaire, Abdou & Pointon (2009) list ways of detecting fraudulent transactions like pair-wise matching, decision trees, clustering techniques, neural networks, and genetic algorithms. 

## Problem Statement 
The problem chosen for this project is to predict fraudulent credit card transactions by using machine learning models. The models are going to be trained using supervised learning. A dataset containing thousands of individual transactions and their respective labels was obtained from Kaggle website (link).
